However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the backend implements the required new date-parameterized due-items query with stable ordering and correct access control.",

      "requirement": "Backend exposes a query that accepts a selected date and returns the authenticated caller’s subtopics whose revision schedule nextReview is on or before that selected date (overdue + due-on-date), in a stable order, with existing access-control behavior, and without changing calendar behavior.",
      "reason": "Frontend adds a hook that calls actor.getSubTopicsForDate(targetDate), but the provided backend diff excerpt for backend/main.mo does not show any new/updated query implementing getSubTopicsForDate (or equivalent), nor any evidence of stable sorting or access-control logic for this new query.",
