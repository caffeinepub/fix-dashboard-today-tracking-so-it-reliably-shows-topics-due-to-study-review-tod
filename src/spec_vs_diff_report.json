  "summary": "The diff implements all requested requirements for manual revision marking with persistent red/green status indicators. Backend adds reviewCount field to RevisionSchedule with migration, frontend adds mark-as-reviewed functionality across calendar, topics, and today views with visual indicators and review count displays.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest constraints explicitly state 'Maintain compatibility with existing isReviewed field in RevisionSchedule' - no mention of adding new fields like reviewCount. The non-goals and requirements focus only on marking revisions as reviewed (isReviewed field), not tracking review counts.",
