  "summary": "Diff introduces shared frontend utility logic to compute (a) due/pending reviews for a selected date (including overdue carry-over, excluding completed) and (b) planned calendar items, and wires this shared logic into TodayView and (at least partially shown) CalendarView to align counts/definitions.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/mentioned a new React Query hook `useGetSubTopicsForDate` for fetching subtopics due on or before a selected date.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to align CalendarView and TodayView counts/labels using a consistent due/pending definition; it does not request adding a new data-fetching hook.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (\"frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts\": mentions \"new hook useGetSubTopicsForDate\")"
