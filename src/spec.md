# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the calendar view, add a redo-next-day option for missed revisions, and show both today's and overdue items in the dashboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the "reviews needing action" indicator from the calendar view; clicking a date will show only topics scheduled for that day
- Add a "redo revision tomorrow" button in the subtopic schedule view that reschedules missed revisions to the next day and recalculates future dates
- Update the dashboard to display two distinct groups: topics due today and overdue/missed topics from previous days

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view cleaner calendar dates with only scheduled topics, easily reschedule missed revisions to tomorrow with one click, and see a clear separation between today's reviews and overdue items on the dashboard.
